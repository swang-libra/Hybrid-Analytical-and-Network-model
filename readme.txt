A novel sensor calibration algorithm called Hybrid Analytical and Network (HAN) model is proposed, which can utilize qualitative physical model to facilitate neural network training. The calibration result of one sensor is also transferable to other sensor calibrations. This project is the source code of HAN model realization. For the detail of HAN model, please refer to the paper "Calibration of Haptic Sensors using Transfer Learning".

For balance calibration, as stated in paper, totally 990 image patches are generated, with 190 of them used for test and the rest (800) for training. Each image patch has size 15x15, which means there are totally 225 pixels inside.
"balance sensor experimental pixel values for training.npy" contains all the image patches used for training, so it has size 800x225. This data is used as input during training.
"balance sensor experimental pixel values for test.npy" contains all the image patches for test, so it has size 190x225. This data is used as input during test.
"balance sensor experimental pressure values for training.npy" contains the experimental pressure values corresponding to those training image patches, so it is one-dimensional and has length 800. This data is used as label during training.
"balance sensor experimental pressure values for test.npy" contains the experimental pressure values corresponding to those test image patches, so it is also one-dimensional and has length 190. This data is used as label during test.
Also as stated in paper, the way to calculate the pressure value corresponding to some pixel value for network is simply setting all 225 inputs equal to this pixel value. Therefore, for convenience, we made the "balance sensor ideal pixel values for calculating pressure-pixel relationship.npy", which has size 180x225. This file contains 180 noise-free image patches with identical pixel values inside each image patch. The pixel values inside the first image patch are all 0. The pixel values inside the second image patch are all 1 and so on. The pixel values inside the last image patch are all 179. If we input these man-made image patches into network, we can easily generate the pressure-pixel relationship for pixel value from 0 to 179.

"Type 1 net_params transferred from balance sensor network.pkl" contains the network parameters from trained Type 1 network in balance sensor calibration.
"Type 2 net_params transferred from balance sensor network.pkl" contains the network parameters from trained Type 2 network in balance sensor calibration.

For skin sensor calibration, as stated in paper, 5 groups of repeated experiments have been done. In each experiment, 13 different weights are applied, so totally 65 different FOV images are captured. For each FOV image, 5 possible FOV size values are extracted by choosing 5 different standard deviation values of Gaussian filter when using Canny operator to segment FOV area. Here FOV size is indicated by the number of pixels inside FOV area.
"skin sensor experimental FOV size values.npy" contains all possible FOV size values corresponding to all experimental FOV images, so it has size 65x5. This data is used as input.
"skin sensor experimental contact force values.npy" contains the experimental contact force values (in unit gf) corresponding to all FOV images, so it is one-dimensional and has length 65. This data is used as label.
