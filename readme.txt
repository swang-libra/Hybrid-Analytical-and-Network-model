A novel sensor calibration algorithm called Hybrid Analytical and Network (HAN) model is proposed, which can utilize qualitative physical model to facilitate neural network training. The calibration result of one sensor is also transferable to other sensor calibrations. This project is the source code of HAN model realization. For the detail of HAN model, please refer to the paper "Calibration of Haptic Sensors using Transfer Learning".
